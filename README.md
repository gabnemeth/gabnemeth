### You found me!  👋


  My name is Gabriel Nemeth and I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics at Hult International Business School where I am getting a hands-on experience with an extremely culturally diverse group of people. Before this Master's, I completed a Master's in Finance in August 2021.

  I’m currently learning how to better analyze and display the results of huge amounts of data using different platforms such as:
  - Python
  - R
  - SQL
  - Tableau
  
  I am currently looking for a full time position in data analysis and/or finance starting in the Summer of 2022, and hope to be on a role where I can help a company achieve its all-important financial goals.

🎾🏆 Fun Fact about me: Went to Penn State as a Student-Athlete and together with my partner reached the number 1 ranking in D1 Varsity Tennis!
